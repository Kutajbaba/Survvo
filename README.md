# Survvo
🧩 About Survvo

Survvo is a community-driven research platform that makes it easier for individuals, small teams, and organizations to recruit participants and collect meaningful insights.
Participants earn tokens for completing surveys and research studies — and researchers can use those tokens to create and distribute their own studies.

Unlike traditional research platforms, Survvo fosters reciprocity and accessibility — making user research affordable, rewarding, and inclusive for everyone.

🎯 Core Idea

We’re building a platform that solves two major challenges in research:
	1.	Low survey response rates – researchers struggle to find participants beyond their networks.
	2.	Limited incentives – participants are rarely motivated to complete surveys.

Survvo connects both sides through a token-powered ecosystem where everyone benefits.
When you contribute as a participant, you earn tokens. When you create a survey, those tokens help you reach the right audience.

⚙️ MVP Focus

The MVP focuses on:
	•	Smart matching between surveys and participants
	•	Token-based reward system
	•	Participant profiles based on interests and experiences
	•	Simple, fast survey creation and completion flow
	•	Community-driven reciprocity (complete to earn, earn to create)
